# Project Description 
    In this project I created the portfolio using react js and scss. The portfolio is with an advanced styling and fully mobile responsive.

# Getting Started with the React App Creation 
    Project can be created in the react js through installing react js using npm and also stored all frontend in the one folder and backend in the another folder.

## Available Scripts 
    In this project directory, you can run the project using:   
        ```
            yarn start 
        ```
           or 
           ```
            npm start
           ```
