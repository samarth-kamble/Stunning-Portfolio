          I'm a third-year student at Vishwakarma Institute of Technology, Pune,
          with a passion for building efficient and scalable web solutions. As a
          full-stack developer with a strong focus on backend development, I
          specialize in creating robust, secure, and high-performance
          server-side applications.

          I'm always eager to learn new technologies, tackle complex challenges,
          and collaborate on exciting projects that push the boundaries of web
          development.
